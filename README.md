# Email Spam Detection using MultinomialNB, Logistic Regression and Decision Tree

## Project Overview
This project implements and compares three machine learning algorithms (Multinomial Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, and Decision Tree) for email spam detection. It aims to accurately classify emails as spam or non-spam using natural language processing and machine learning techniques.

## Features
- Data preprocessing and text vectorization
- Implementation of three different classification algorithms
- Performance comparison and evaluation
- Visualization of results

## Installation
1. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/kiranshahzadii/email-spam-detection.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
```bash
cd email-spam-detection
```

3. Install the required packages:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
1. Open the Jupyter notebook:
```bash
jupyter notebook Email_Spam_Detection.ipynb
```

2. Follow the instructions in the notebook to run the analysis and classification models.

## Data
The project uses a dataset containing labeled email messages (spam and non-spam). The dataset includes the email content and corresponding labels.

## Models
We implement and compare three classification models:
1. Multinomial Naive Bayes
2. Logistic Regression
3. Decision Tree

## Results
The models' performances are compared using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Detailed results and visualizations can be found in the notebook.

## Contributing
Contributions to improve the models or extend the analysis are welcome. Please fork the repository and submit a pull request with your changes.
